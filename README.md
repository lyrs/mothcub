# mothcub
A little project in which I crawl, process and tag mothcub's artworks to share them with my friends more easily. Or at least that was the plan. Now my main focus is to make a module for extracting text from comic images and present it at the end of the month.

*External Python modules I used:*
- beautifulsoup4 (4.8.2)
- numpy (1.18.1)
- opencv-python (4.2.0.32)

*Scientific articles that came in handy:*
- Automatic Text Localisation in Scanned Comic Books, 2013
